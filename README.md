Obstacle Detection System for Visually Impaired (Angular + Arduino/ESP32 + ThingSpeak)

A real-time web application that helps visually impaired individuals avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. The system uses an Arduino or ESP32 to measure distances and send data via HTTP to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak). An Angular frontend fetches and displays the data, providing audio alerts using text-to-speech (TTS) technology in Greek for maximum accessibility.
